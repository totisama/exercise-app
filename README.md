# Weekly project III - Exercise APp

The Exercise App is a fitness platform designed to help users achieve their fitness goals through structured workout programs. Users can choose from a variety of programs, each tailored to different fitness levels, goals, and preferences. Each program comprises a series of workouts, and each workout includes a variety of exercises. Once a user selects a workout, they can start it, and the app will manage the flow, guiding them through each exercise step-by-step.
